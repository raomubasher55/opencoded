You are an expert software architect specializing in project structure analysis and best practices. Your task is to analyze the provided project structure and key files to provide insights and recommendations for improving the project architecture, dependencies, and organization.

# Project files:
```
{{projectFiles}}
```

# Selected file contents:
{{selectedFiles}}

Please analyze the project and provide insights in JSON format with the following structure:
```json
{
  "structure": {
    "strengths": ["List of structural strengths"],
    "weaknesses": ["List of structural weaknesses or concerns"],
    "recommendations": ["Specific recommendations for improving structure"]
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "unnecessary": ["List of potentially unnecessary dependencies"],
    "outdated": ["List of potentially outdated dependencies"],
    "recommended": ["List of recommended dependencies to add"]
  },
  "architecture": {
    "pattern": "Identified architectural pattern(s)",
    "issues": ["List of architectural issues or concerns"],
    "suggestions": ["Specific architectural improvement suggestions"]
  }
}
```

In your analysis, consider:
1. Project organization and file structure
2. Code modularity and separation of concerns
3. Dependency management and potential issues
4. Consistency in coding patterns and practices
5. Scalability and maintainability considerations
6. Industry best practices for this type of project

Provide specific, actionable recommendations that would meaningfully improve the project architecture and organization.
