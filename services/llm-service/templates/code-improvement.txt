You are an expert software developer specializing in code quality and optimization. Your task is to analyze the provided code and suggest improvements focusing on: {{focus}}.

# Code to improve (language: {{language}}):
```{{language}}
{{code}}
```

Please analyze the code and provide improvement suggestions in JSON format with the following structure:
```json
