# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 2 focused on implementing core services for the OpenCoded microservices architecture. This phase included the following key components:

1. **OAuth Integration**
   - Added GitHub and Google OAuth strategies to the auth service
   - Implemented user profile linking for seamless authentication

2. **File Operations Service**
   - Created a dedicated service for file system operations
   - Implemented secure file reading, writing, and listing capabilities
   - Added glob pattern matching for file discovery
   - Implemented grep-like content search functionality
   - Added file watching with event-based notifications

3. **LLM Service**
   - Implemented a flexible provider-based architecture
   - Created adapters for OpenAI and Anthropic
   - Added streaming completions support
   - Implemented token counting and context management
   - Created a prompt template system with variable substitution

4. **Session Management Service**
   - Implemented conversation persistence with MongoDB
   - Created session state management
   - Added history retrieval and navigation
   - Implemented context window management

5. **Enhanced CLI Features**
   - Added syntax highlighting for various programming languages
   - Implemented advanced terminal UI components
   - Created a shell integration framework for command execution
   - Added project environment detection

## Technical Details

### Auth Service

The Auth Service now supports multiple authentication methods:
- Traditional username/password authentication
- OAuth integration with GitHub and Google
- API key authentication for programmatic access

User roles have been simplified to:
- `admin`: Full system access
- `user`: Standard user access

### File Operations Service

The File Operations Service provides a secure interface to the file system:
- Path validation and sandboxing
- File content reading/writing
- Directory listing and metadata
- Glob pattern matching for finding files
- Content search with regular expressions
- Real-time file watching using Chokidar

### LLM Service

The LLM Service abstracts various AI providers behind a unified API:
- Provider-agnostic message format
- Standardized function/tool calling
- Support for OpenAI and Anthropic models
- Configuration management for API keys and model settings
- Prompt template system with variable substitution

### Session Management Service

The Session Management Service maintains conversation history:
- MongoDB-based persistent storage
- Session and message management
- User-based access control
- Automatic context window management
- Message retrieval with pagination

### CLI Enhancements

The CLI now offers a more sophisticated user experience:
- Syntax highlighting for code display
- Advanced terminal UI components (tables, progress bars, etc.)
- Shell integration for running commands
- Development environment detection

## Next Steps

With the core services in place, the next phase can focus on:
1. Tool execution service for running code
2. Chat communication for real-time interactions
3. Advanced AI capabilities
4. Performance optimization and enterprise features
