## Implementation Highlights

### Sandbox Service Enhancement

The sandbox service was significantly enhanced to support multiple languages and execution environments:

```typescript
// Container-based execution with language-specific configurations
async executeInContainer(
  code: string, 
  language: string, 
  resourceLimits: ResourceLimits, 
  executionId?: string,
  options?: ExecutionOptions
): Promise<ExecutionResult>
```

### Real-time Socket Implementation

A new real-time communication layer was added for instant updates:

```typescript
// RealtimeSocket class for WebSocket communication
export class RealtimeSocket extends EventEmitter {
  connect(userId: string, sessionId?: string): Promise<void>
  send(event: string, data: any): void
  joinSession(sessionId: string): void
}
```

### Advanced Code Analysis

New AI-powered code analysis capabilities were implemented:

```typescript
// CodeAnalysisService with advanced capabilities
export class CodeAnalysisService {
  generateDocumentation(code: string, language: string): Promise<string>
  generateTests(code: string, language: string): Promise<string>
  analyzeSecurity(code: string, language: string): Promise<SecurityAnalysis>
  suggestImprovements(code: string, language: string): Promise<Suggestions>
}
```

### Performance Optimization

Caching and performance monitoring were added:

```typescript
// Caching service for improved performance
export class CachingService {
  async getOrSet<T>(
    key: string | any,
    getter: () => Promise<T>,
    ttl?: number
  ): Promise<T>
}

// Telemetry for performance tracking
export class TelemetryService {
  trackMetric(name: string, value: number, tags?: Record<string, string>): void
  async trackTime<T>(name: string, fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>
}
```

## Next Steps
