# OpenCode Phase 5: Advanced AI Capabilities & Enterprise Features

## Overview

Phase 5 enhances the OpenCode platform with advanced AI capabilities, enterprise-grade security features, extension marketplace infrastructure, performance optimizations, and comprehensive analytics. These features transform OpenCode into a fully-featured collaborative development platform suitable for both small teams and enterprise environments.

## Key Features

### 1. Team-Aware LLM Assistance

The LLM integration now includes team context awareness, allowing the AI to provide more relevant and personalized assistance:

- **Context-Aware AI**: Understands team structures, project organization, and user roles
- **Collaborative Context**: References shared session history, threads, and comments
- **Team Pattern Recognition**: Learns coding patterns, naming conventions, and documentation styles from team activity
- **Personalized Responses**: Tailors suggestions based on user's role and team preferences

### 2. Enhanced Security for Enterprise Deployments

Enterprise-grade security features have been implemented to ensure data protection and compliance:

- **Advanced Security Middleware**: Configurable security levels with appropriate HTTP headers
- **Secure Data Handling**: Encryption for sensitive data with key rotation
- **IP-Based Access Controls**: Restrict access based on IP addresses or ranges
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Tamper-proof audit trails for compliance and security

### 3. Extension Marketplace Infrastructure

A complete extension ecosystem allowing teams to customize and extend the platform:

- **Extension Discovery**: Search, filter, and browse available extensions
- **Rating and Reviews**: Community-driven quality assessment
- **Secure Installation**: Verification and sandboxing for third-party extensions
- **Version Management**: Support for multiple versions and dependency resolution

### 4. Performance Optimizations for Larger Teams

Performance enhancements to support larger teams and codebases:

- **Multi-Layer Caching**: Memory and Redis-based caching with TTL management
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections for high concurrency
- **File Chunking**: Efficient handling of large file transfers
- **Worker Pool**: Distributed processing for compute-intensive operations

### 5. Analytics and Insights for Collaborative Development

Comprehensive analytics and dashboards for understanding team performance:

- **Real-Time Analytics**: WebSocket-based live updates of activity metrics
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Team, user, and tool usage visualizations
- **Collaboration Metrics**: Measure team effectiveness and interaction patterns
- **Tool Usage Insights**: Understand which tools provide the most value

```

Available metrics include:

- User activity and tool usage
- Team collaboration metrics
- Real-time active sessions
- Tool execution statistics
- Session insights and timeline

### Enterprise Configuration

To enable enterprise features:

1. Set the following environment variables:
   ```
   ENTERPRISE_MODE=true
   SECURITY_LEVEL=high  # options: standard, high, maximum
   ```
2. Configure additional security options:
   ```
   ALLOWED_IPS=192.168.1.1,10.0.0.0/24
   MASTER_KEY=your-secure-key
   ```
3. Enable audit logging:
   ```
   AUDIT_LOGGING=true
   AUDIT_LOG_PATH=/var/log/opencode
   ```
